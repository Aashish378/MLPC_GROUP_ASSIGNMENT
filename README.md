# MLPC GroupAssignment 0369970

## Overview
This project demonstrates the implementation of **Smart Grid Energy Distribution Optimization** using **Genetic Algorithms** (GA) and **Parallel Computing** techniques. It is a group assignment submitted for the ITS66604 - Machine Learning and Parallel Computing module.

## Features
- Mathematical formulation of a multi-objective optimization problem
- Chromosome encoding with real-valued gene representation
- Custom fitness function incorporating cost, loss, and reliability
- Genetic operations: selection, crossover, and mutation
- Parallel implementation using Python's `concurrent.futures.ThreadPoolExecutor`
- Performance comparison of serial vs parallel GA
- Visualization of energy source utilization and demand patterns
- Comparative analysis with baseline algorithms (Greedy, Proportional)

## Technologies Used
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- `concurrent.futures`
- Jupyter Notebook

## File Structure
- `MLPC_GroupAssignment_0369970.ipynb`: Main notebook containing code, visualizations, and analysis
- `README.md`: Project documentation and instructions

## How to Run
1. Clone this repository or upload the notebook to Google Colab.
2. Run each cell sequentially.
3. Modify parameters (nodes, sources, hours) as needed.
4. View plots and performance results inline.

## Contributions
- **Aashish Tamang**: All-rounder (Algorithm development, parallel implementation, visualization, documentation)
- **Riya Maharjan, Khushi Bista, Sujal GC, Bisakha Shrestha**: Collaborative development and testing
